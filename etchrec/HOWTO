Howto build a full rails stack, on Debian Etch:

get the etchrec gem: 

  sudo gem install etchrec
                                                           
login to your server, via. ssh, and change the root password (if you haven't already).  Logout.

Next, generate a configuration file by standing in your the root project directory:
	# uncompleted etchrec generator here #

Modify this config file to suit your needs.
	
Then run the following tasks:

cap setup_admin_account_as_root 
 (add root password at prompt)

cap setup_ssh_keys

cap enable_security
  enter in a new port for ssh (and make sure to change this in deploy.rb)
  This will also remove the ability to login as root via ssh

cap install_rails_stack

cap setup

cap deploy_with_migrations

cap restart_apache
